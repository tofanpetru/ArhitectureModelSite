Ma simt bine  -- I feel good

**My level of English is A2, and that's why I speak bad
and depend on the translator

**I would suggest that
it would be better to propose that we have the discussion on the phone (in this case)

**I would consider that the client should not receive 
emails in such an aggressive way

**I would think we would need to arrange the paragraphs

If there are several topics covered, I would consider 
them to be separate emails



**If I wait for the moment when I will be ready, it consumes a lot of my time, 
so I learn more things at a fast pace

**I like it because I have team and many people surround me, 
who help me grow faster

**i learn many things from my collegs
